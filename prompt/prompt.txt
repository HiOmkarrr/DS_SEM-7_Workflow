i am providing you a set of documents of experiments that i have implemented for the data science subject lab.
now i want to implement experiment 7 and 8(first)
Experiment 7
Aim: CI/CD Pipeline with Open Source Tools
Objective: Automate testing, version checks, and deployment using GitHub Actions.
 Detailed Steps
- Create GitHub Actions workflow YAML
- Add test, lint, and build jobs
- Pull data/models with DVC if needed
- Test pipeline on push to `main`
Open-Source Tools
GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, DVC
 Deliverables
- Workflow YAML
- CI logs/screenshots
Conclusion


Experiment 8
 Aim: Dashboard, Responsible AI Reporting & Final Portfolio
Objective: Build Streamlit/Dash dashboard, write Responsible AI report, and publish final repo.
 Detailed Steps
- Develop dashboard for predictions & insights
- Include SHAP plots, metrics, drift checks
- Write Responsible AI checklist (fairness, privacy, consent)
- Publish final code, notebooks, API, and workflow on GitHub
Open-Source Tools
Streamlit, Dash, Markdown, Jupyter, GitHub/GitLab
 Deliverables
- Streamlit app link
- Responsible_AI.md
- Final public repo link
Conclusion




now i want a all comprehensive software that demonstrates the working of all this in a systematic, pipelined manner so that i can present the working of all the pipeline in step by step manner
for example: I want to first present the problem statement that i have selected to a page on the software will tell about the problem statement, then comes data scraping, data cleaning and feature engineering part, i want to have data import as well as scrape option(scraping using praw) in the software. then comes the eda part, i want proper visualizations as per the finalized dataset given and a simpler version of the colab file given
then comes the model selection, and why we have selected that particular model (implement just like the specific respective colab file given)
then apply explainable AI (XAI) methods (SHAP & LIME) for interpreting model predictions and evaluate fairness using Fairlearn
then Containerization & API Deployment
now note that i want to demonstrate and present the working of this in step by step experiment wise manner and also implement ci/cd using GitHub actions workflow automation over it
